# Tumbller Telemetry
üåê [eumonti.github.io/tumbller-telemetry](https://eumonti.github.io/tumbller-telemetry/)

This web app is meant as a telemetry system for the ELEGOO Tumbller self-balancing robot https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-tumbller-self-balancing-robot-car.
By default the robot sends the angle measured by the IMU, which will be traced in real time.
